# JAX-Based LLM Implementation

This repository contains a simplified implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) using JAX.

## Features

*   **Minimal Dependencies:**  Relies primarily on JAX for numerical computation and model building.
*   **Transformer Architecture:**  Implements the core Transformer architecture, including self-attention and feed-forward layers.
*   **Training Loop:** Includes a basic training loop with gradient descent optimization.
*   **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to generate text using the trained model.
*   **Clear and Concise Code:**  Prioritizes readability and understanding.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <git-repo-url>
    cd jax-llm
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (You'll likely need a `requirements.txt` file with at least `jax`, `jaxlib`, and potentially libraries like `numpy`, `optax` (for optimization), and `datasets` (if you're using a Hugging Face dataset).  Adjust as needed.)

## Usage

The main script is `main.py`.  You can run it using:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
